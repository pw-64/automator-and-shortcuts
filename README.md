# automator-and-shortcuts
A collection of Automator and Shortcuts scripts that I have made to speed up tasks.

## Compress
Create a zip of the selected files/folders

## Create New File
Creates a blank file in the current dir. Add a file extension and fill with data.

## Reset Time
Enable network time (NTP) to reset the time to whatever it should be.

## Start PD
Disable network time, set the time to somewhere in the past and launch Parallels Desktop.
